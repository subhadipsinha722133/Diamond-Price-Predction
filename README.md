## 📖 Description  

Diamond pricing depends on several key attributes such as **carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and table**.  
This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to accurately predict the price of a diamond based on these features.  

An interactive **Streamlit web application** is provided, where users can input diamond parameters and instantly get the predicted price.  

The project is useful for:  
- 💎 Jewelry businesses to estimate fair pricing  
- 📊 Data science learners to explore regression modeling  
- 🛠️ End users who want quick price predictions before purchase or sale
  
## 🚀 Approach  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled categorical variables using encoding techniques.  
   - Scaled/normalized numerical features where necessary.  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Built a **Machine Learning model using Scikit-learn** to predict diamond prices.  

3. **Deployment**  
   - Deployed the model using **Streamlit** to create an interactive web app where users can input diamond features and get a predicted price.
